With the release of version 3.0, {{site.base_gateway}} now ships with a powerful and efficient rule based engine using
a domain-specific language called Expressions. Expressions can be used to perform tasks such as defining
complex routing logic that was previously not possible with the pre 3.0 router.
This document serves as a reference for the Expressions language and how it can be used.

If you want to learn how to configure routes using Expressions as well
as available fields, read [How to configure routes using Expressions](/gateway/{{ page.kong_version }}/key-concepts/routes/expressions).
