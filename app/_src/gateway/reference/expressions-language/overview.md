title: Overview

With the release of version 3.0, {{site.base_gateway}} now ships with a powerful and efficient rule based engine using
a domain-specific language called Expressions. Expressions can be used to perform tasks such as defining
complex routing logic that was previously not possible with the pre 3.0 era router.
This document serves as a reference for the Expressions language and how it can be used.

Begin with the [Quickstart](/gateway/latest/reference/expressions-language/quickstart/) page if you are new to this and need some familiarization of the language.

Refer to the [Language References](/gateway/latest/reference/expressions-language/language-references/) once you are familiar with the basics
and needs to understand everything the Expressions language has to provide.

If you want to learn how to configure routes using Expressions as well
as available fields, read [How to configure Routes using Expressions](/gateway/{{ page.kong_version }}/key-concepts/routes/expressions).

Finally, you can checkout the [Performance](/gateway/latest/reference/expressions-language/performance/) page to understand performance characteristics when
using the Expressions router and how to optimize your routes.
